# DecisionTreeStructure
Understand what happening behind the process of training/prediction of a decision tree

TODO
- visualize decision path
- visualize node/leaf impurity (as matplolib)
- visualize node/leaf samples
- visualize decision path, leaf, all nodes splits (ex. histograms - like in animl)
